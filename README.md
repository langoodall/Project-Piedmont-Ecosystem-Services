Overview of Research:

Understanding the future forests of North Carolina and the potential pathways they make take in getting there is a crucial aspect of providing the continued and sustainable delivery of ecosystem services that can be found in the forests of NC. 

The Piedmont ecoregion in North Carolina is of particular interest due to it's high population within the state, it's high ratio of private vs. public forest land ownership and it's distinct composition in relation to it's geogrpahic neighbours the Coastal Plain and thr Blue Ridge Mountains.

Researchers and managers need to forecast the potential futures of the forests they study and manage, how the different management techniques will produce different ecosystem service trade-offs and synergies, and how the delivery of these ecosystem services will vary with different drought based climactic futures. LANDIS-II is a spatially explicit, landscape dynamics model capable of simulating forested landscapes at larger spatial scales (Scheller et al. 2007) to capture cross scale processes.
