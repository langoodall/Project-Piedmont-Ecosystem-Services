Overview of Research:

Understanding the future forests of North Carolina and the potential pathways they make take in getting there is a crucial aspect of providing the continued and sustainable delivery of ecosystem services that can be found in the forests of NC. 

The Piedmont ecoregion in North Carolina is of particular interest due to it's high population within the state, it's high ratio of private vs. public forest land ownership and it's distinct composition in relation to it's geogrpahic neighbours the Coastal Plain and thr Blue Ridge Mountains.
